# Intercal
## A minimalist, typographic calendar, inspired by KAL

Thrown together with a few lines of python because I needed something for my wall.

Set in the beautiful [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) typeface.

The only dependency is `fpdf` for the PDF generation.
Multiple languages are supported and can be added on the top of intercal.py
